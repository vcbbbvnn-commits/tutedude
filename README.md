# Assignment 1 — Basic Mathematical Operations

**Description**

This small Python program prompts the user to enter two numbers and then computes and displays the results of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Files**

- `q1.py` — The program that reads two numbers from the user and prints the results.

**Usage**

From the `assignment1` folder run:

```bash
python q1.py
```

If you're using the workspace virtual environment, run:

```bash
C:/Users/USER/OneDrive/Desktop/tutedude/.venv/Scripts/python.exe q1.py
```

Then enter the two numbers when prompted:

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
```

**Example output**

```
Results:
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0
```

**Notes**

- The program expects numeric input (integers or decimals). Non-numeric input will raise an error.
- Division by zero will raise an error in the current `q1.py` implementation; you can update the script to handle this case if desired.

If you want, I can update `q1.py` to handle invalid input and division-by-zero gracefully — shall I proceed?
